# IT-DataProcessing-Multithreading

Canine Class DNA was utilized to showcase the power of multithreading scientific data.  Multithreading refers to having a single processor/CPU handle multiple tasks "threads" simultaneously.

# Data and Results
A single class sample of the dog canine DNA was utilized for this project.  The full dataset can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/code/singhakash/dna-sequencing-with-machine-learning/data


Time Elapsed, 0.0 : Multithreading

# Threads Tested
1: Single Nucleotide Count
2: Unique Nucleotide Pairings Where Order Matters
3: Most Frequent Identifiable Nucleotide Pairing

Results:
Single Nucleotide Count, {'A': 172, 'T': 126, 'G': 359, 'C': 387}
Unique Nucleotide Pairings Where Order Matters, ['AT', 'GG', 'AA', 'AC', 'CC', 'TT', 'CT', 'CG', 'GA', 'GC', 'TG', 'TC', 'AG', 'TA', 'GT', 'CA']
Most Frequent Identifiable Nucleotide Pairing, {'GC': 85}
